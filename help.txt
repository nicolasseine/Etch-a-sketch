I've spent 3 hours yesterday wondering why I can't make `element.style.backgroundColor()`
work properly :

On the following script, the class is removed but the inline background-color remains the same :
```function clearGrid() {
    Array.from(cells).forEach((cell) => {
        cell.style.backgroundColor = "white";
        cell.classList.remove("painted");
    })
};```
I also tried with `cell.style.remove("background-color")`, which doen't do anything either...
I'm lost here !
