# Etch-a-sketch

My first project for [The Odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project), using vanilla HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript.

The UI is in french, but I'm sure you will easily get it. I tried to make it as nice as I could, and I will surely tweak it a bit later.

For a first coding experience, it was great fun !
